You should probably make sure to download the xlsx sheet yourself, that way you know it's up to date.

In order to get .csv files, download the xlsx version of the sheet and place it in xlsx2csv. Change the params (if necessary) in [convert_xlsx_csv].bat.
Once ran, it should place all the csv files in a BlackMarketVehicles.csv folder.
